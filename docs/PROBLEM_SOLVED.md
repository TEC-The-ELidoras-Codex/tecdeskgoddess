# 🔧 PROBLEM SOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL

## ❌ What Was Wrong:
- **API Server Path Issue**: The API server was looking for HTML files in `src/` directory
- **File Location Mismatch**: HTML files were in root directory, but server was in `src/`
- **404 Errors**: Web interface couldn't find the HTML files
- **Server Crashed**: Previous server instance stopped unexpectedly

## ✅ What I Fixed:

### 1. **API Server File Serving**
```python
# OLD (broken):
@app.route('/')
def serve_chat():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'tec_chat.html')

# NEW (working):
@app.route('/')
def serve_chat():
    return send_from_directory('..', 'tec_chat.html')

@app.route('/tec_complete_interface.html')
def serve_complete_interface():
    return send_from_directory('..', 'tec_complete_interface.html')

@app.route('/<path:filename>')
def serve_static(filename):
    return send_from_directory('..', filename)
```

### 2. **System Restart**
- Properly restarted the TEC API server
- Fixed path references to parent directory
- Added route for complete interface

## ✅ Current Status - EVERYTHING WORKING:

### **API Endpoints** ✅
