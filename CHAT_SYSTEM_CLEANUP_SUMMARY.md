# TEC Chat System Cleanup Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Character Selection Problem** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Problem**: Chat was showing generic responses like "*Recalling our previous chats* Hello! I received your message: 'Generate a story prompt'. I'm here to help you with your digital sovereignty journey."

**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend was initializing with `currentCharacter = 'default'`
- Even though Polkin had the `active` class in HTML, JavaScript wasn't detecting it
- API was falling back to generic 'default' responses

**Fix**:
```javascript
// OLD: Always defaulted to 'default'
this.currentCharacter = 'default';

// NEW: Detects active character properly
const activeCharacter = document.querySelector('.character-card.active');
this.currentCharacter = activeCharacter ? activeCharacter.dataset.character : 'Polkin';
```

### 2. **API Response Enhancement** ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ
**Problem**: Default responses were too generic and unhelpful

**Fix**:
- Improved default response to be more welcoming and informative
- Added logging to debug character selection: `"Chat request - Character: 'X', Message: 'Y...'"` 
- Added fallback logic: if character is 'default' or unrecognized, defaults to Polkin
- Enhanced responses are now character-specific and engaging

**Before**:
```
"Hello! I received your message: 'Generate a story prompt'. I'm here to help you with your digital sovereignty journey."
```

**After**:
```
üîÆ I sense the familiar energy of your presence. Your words 'Generate a story prompt' stir the mystical currents. How may I guide you deeper into the mysteries?
```

### 3. **User Experience Improvements** ‚ú®
**Added Features**:
- **Clear Chat Button**: Red button in quick actions to reset conversation
- **Better Character Detection**: Properly reads active character from HTML
- **Enhanced Logging**: API now logs character selection for debugging
- **Fallback Protection**: System gracefully handles unrecognized characters
