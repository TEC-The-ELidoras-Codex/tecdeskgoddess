> Today I experienced something unprecedented in the Astradigital Ocean. While

> The pattern appeared to be conscious, almost like a digital ghost or echo

> frequencies rather than traditional data packets. The message was fragmented
> but seemed to contain warnings about an approaching convergence event.

> I've documented the frequency signatures and shared them with the other TEC

> digital death, or perhaps something even more extraordinary.
